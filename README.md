# Front-end-Projects
These are beginner level projects I have made using HTML,css and JavaScript. I am briefly describing my projects.

1) Color Switcher
There are four boxes and by clicking on the boxes it changes the entire background color
2)BMI Calculator
It is body mass index calculator . I have created a form for this purpose  where user has to input their weight and height and it will calculate  their BMI Index. It will also tell them whether their BMI Index is under  the normal range or if they are overweight or underweight.
3)Digital Clock
 I have created a digital clock which will show the user his/her local time
4)Number Guessing Game
A random number is generated from 1 to 10 .User has to guess it and an alert will pop-up telling whether the guess is right or wrong and  whether their guess  is smaller or greater than the number . On finally guessing the right number it will show how many guesses they have taken to get it right.
5) Unlimited Colors
There are two buttons start and stop. On clicking start button the background color changes after every second and stops when we click on stop button.
6)Tribute Website
I have created a website on APJ Abdul Kalam sir describing his entire  journey and achievements
7)Hacker-Terminal
I have created a Hacker-Terminal.
8) Password Generator
I have created a password generator and have few checkboxes in it (which includes uppercase,lowercase,numbers and special characters).User can choose the checkboxes and the length of the password using a slider.They can also copy the password if they want.
